## Git Terminology

<span class="oi oi-clock" style="color: orange;">  6 minutes</span>

To understand Git, you have to understand the terminology. Here's a short list of terms that Git users frequently use. Don't be concerned about the details for now; all these terms will become familiar as you work your way through the hands-on exercises in this lesson.


- **Working tree**: The set of nested directories and files that contain the project that's being worked on.

- **Repository (repo)**: The directory, located at the top level of a working tree, where Git keeps all the history and metadata for a project. Repositories are almost always referred to as repos. A bare repository is one that isn't part of a working tree; it's used for sharing or backup. A bare repo is usually a directory with a name that ends in .git—for example, project.git.

- **Hash:** A number produced by a hash function that represents the contents of a file or another object as a fixed number of digits. Git uses hashes that are 160 bits long. One advantage to using hashes is that Git can tell whether a file has changed by hashing its contents and comparing the result to the previous hash. If the file time-and-date stamp is changed, but the file hash isn’t changed, Git knows the file contents aren’t changed.

- **Object:** A Git repo contains four types of objects, each uniquely identified by an SHA-1 hash. A blob object contains an ordinary file. A tree object represents a directory; it contains names, hashes, and permissions. A commit object represents a specific version of the working tree. A tag is a name attached to a commit.

- **Commit:** When used as a verb, commit means to make a commit object. This action takes its name from commits to a database. It means you are committing the changes you have made so that others can eventually see them, too.

- **Branch:** A branch is a named series of linked commits. The most recent commit on a branch is called the head. The default branch, which is created when you initialize a repository, is called ```main```, (in older repos, you might still see the older name ```master```. The head of the current branch is named ```HEAD```. Branches are an incredibly useful feature of Git because they allow developers to work independently (or together) in branches and later merge their changes into the default branch.

- **Remote:** A remote is a named reference to another Git repository. When you create a repo, Git creates a remote named ```origin``` that is the default remote for push and pull operations.

- **Commands, subcommands, and options:** Git operations are performed by using commands like ```git push``` and ```git pull```. git is the command, and push or pull is the subcommand. The subcommand specifies the operation you want Git to perform. Commands frequently are accompanied by options, which use hyphens (-) or double hyphens (--). For example, ```git reset --hard```.

These terms and others, like **push** and **pull**, will make more sense shortly. But you have to start *somewhere*, and you might find it helpful to come back and review this glossary of terms after you finish the lesson.

## The Git command line

Several different interfaces are available for Git. Many programming editors, like Microsoft Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Visual Studio, also have an interface to Git. While Git is pretty standardized, the editor-integrated Git interfaces typically don't provide you the full-fledged features of the tool. For 95% of the users and use-cases, this is probably already too much. None of them implement all of Git's functionality.

To give you the opportunity to understand Git mechanisms better, we offer a hands-on exercise in this lesson, using the **Git command line**—specifically. The command line is the most powerful interface to Git, and it's sometimes required to fall back to it, when the GUI is throwing errors or not working as expected.

## Installing Git on your local machine

Before you start using Git, you have to make it available on your computer. Even if it’s already installed, it’s probably a good idea to update to the latest version. You can either install it as a package or via another installer, or download the source code and compile it yourself.

### Installing On Windows

There are a few ways to install Git on Windows. The most official build is available for download on the Git website. Just go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and the download will start automatically. Note that this is a project called **Git for Windows**, which is separate from Git itself; for more information on it, go to https://gitforwindows.org.

To get an automated installation you can use the **Git Chocolatey package**, by running the following command:

```choco install git.install```

<div style="background: lightgreen; 
            font-size: 14px; 
            color: black;
            padding: 5px; 
            border: 1px solid green; 
            margin: 5px;">
            
**Note:** the Chocolatey package is community maintained and requires the installation (https://chocolatey.org/install) of the Chocolatey Package Manager on your local machine.
</div>

Another option is to install via winget tool, by typing this command in command prompt or Powershell:

```winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget```

<div style="background: lightgreen; 
            font-size: 14px; 
            color: black;
            padding: 5px; 
            border: 1px solid green; 
            margin: 5px;">
            
**Note:** more information on the Microsoft Winget Package Tool can be found here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget.
</div>

After installing either version of the Git for Windows, type **Git** in the Windows Search. Note several Git options appear, **Git CMD**, **Git GUI** and **Git Bash**.

**Git Bash** is the closest to the Linux version and somewhat considered the standard across all platforms. 

### Installing on Linux

If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. If you’re on Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:

```$ sudo dnf install git-all```

If you’re on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try apt:

```$ sudo apt install git-all```

For more options, there are instructions for installing on several different Unix distributions on the Git website, at https://git-scm.com/download/linux.

### Installing On MacOS

There are several ways to install Git on macOS. The easiest is probably to install the **Xcode Command Line Tools**. On Ventura (macOS 13) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.

```$ git --version```

If you don’t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at https://git-scm.com/download/mac.

            border: 1px solid white; 
            margin: 5px;">

**Tip:** Git is also integrated in Azure Cloud Shell, allowing for a source control integration, directly from within the Azure Portal.

## Basic Git Command Options

Git works by remembering the changes to your files as if it's taking snapshots of your file system. We'll cover a few basic commands to start tracking files in your repo. Then, you'll save your first "snapshot" for Git to compare against.

**git status**
The first and most commonly used Git command is git status. You will use it in the first exercise, to see that you had initialized your Git repo properly.

git status displays the state of the working tree (and of the staging area—we'll talk more about the staging area soon). It lets you see which changes are currently being tracked by Git, so you can decide whether you want to ask Git to take another snapshot.

**git add**
git add is the command you use to tell Git to start keeping track of changes in certain files.

The technical term is staging these changes. You'll use git add to stage changes to prepare for a commit. All changes in files that have been added but not yet committed are stored in the staging area.

**git commit**
After you've staged some changes for commit, you can save your work to a snapshot by invoking the git commit command.

Commit is both a verb and a noun. It has essentially the same meaning as when you commit to a plan or commit a change to a database. As a verb, committing changes means you put a copy (of the file, directory, or other "stuff") in the repository as a new version. As a noun, a commit is the small chunk of data that gives the changes you committed a unique identity. The data that's saved in a commit includes the author's name and e-mail address, the date, comments about what you did (and why), an optional digital signature, and the unique identifier of the preceding commit.

**git log**
The git log command allows you to see information about previous commits. Each commit has a message attached to it (a commit message), and the git log command prints information about the most recent commits, like their time stamp, the author, and a commit message. This command helps you keep track of what you've been doing and what changes have been saved.

**git help**
You've already tried out the git help command, but it's worth reminding you about. Use this command to easily get information about all the commands you've learned so far, and more.

Remember, each command comes with its own help page, too. You can find these help pages by typing git <command> --help. For example, git commit --help brings up a page that tells you more about the git commit command and how to use it.
