# GIT BASICS

## Introduction

<span class="oi oi-clock" style="color: orange;">  3 minutes</span>

In today's fast-paced digital world, efficient collaboration and seamless version control are paramount for software development projects. **Git, a powerful distributed version control system**, has emerged as the go-to solution for managing source code and facilitating teamwork. This lesson aims to provide a concise overview of Git, its features, and its benefits to developers and teams.

Actually, you might wonder why you are reading this, as you might not consider yourself a developer. That's the **beauty of Git source control**: it tracks changes in files and folders, but doesn't limit the source to development language code. Git source control can be used for a lot of different source files collaboration scenarios, such as Azure templates (ARM, Bicep, Terraform,...), traditional PowerShell or Bash scripts, Jupyter Runbooks, etc... Git can also be used to track changes in documentation files in text or Markdown format (like the file you are reading right now...)

In the specific context of this learning journey, you will use Git soure control for **Microsoft Official Courseware (MOC) Labs** and their corresponding instructions. For several years already, all Microsoft training-related labs have been open-sourced on GitHub, allowing anyone in the world, including you, to collaborate.

## Version Control
Version control is a system that **records changes to a file or set of files** over time so that you can recall specific versions later. So ideally, we can place any file in the computer on version control. If you are wondering why, it is because a Version Control System (VCS) allows you to *revert your files back to any previous state, or revert the entire project folder(s) you have been working on back to a previous state*. By using Version Control, you can *review changes made over time*, see *who last made changes to the source files* which might be causing a problem, who introduced *an issue*, when it got introduced, and much more. Using a VCS also typically means that *in case of a screw-up*, the previous state can **generally be recovered easily** (although honestly, that is the biggest misconception in the use of Version Control, as often users assume they deleted everything and it is lost forever). 

## Git Version Control
There are several Version Control systems available, but **Git is definitely the most popular**. By using Git, one can track changes in computer files on a local machine, as well as coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Git is defined as a Distributed Version Control System. This means, there is no centralized copy of all the files. Instead, every user “clones” a copy of a repository (a collection of files) and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This clone has all of the metadata of the original while the original itself is stored on a self-hosted server or a third party hosting service like **GitHub or Azure DevOps**.

**Tip:** GitHub is relying on Git for its Source Control management, but Git is not owned by GitHub.

This means that even if you're using a centralized workflow as concept, every user essentially has a *full backup* of the main server. Each of these copies could be pushed up to replace the main server in the event of a crash or corruption. In effect, there is **no single point of failure with Git** unless there is only a single copy of the repository.

The data model that Git uses ensures the **cryptographic integrity** of every bit of your project. Every file and commit is checksummed and retrieved by its checksum when checked back out. It's impossible to get anything out of Git other than the exact bits you put in. It is also impossible to change any file, date, commit message, or any other data in a Git repository without changing the IDs of everything after it. This means that if you have a commit ID, you can be assured not only that your project is exactly the same as when it was committed, but that nothing in its history was changed.

Git also helps you synchronise code between multiple people. So imagine you and your team members are collaborating on a project (*in our case, the project is the Microsoft Learning Repository in GitHub, and the team members are the open-source community*). You all are working on the same project files. Now Git takes those changes you and your team made independently and **merges** them to a single “**Main**” repository. So by using Git you can ensure you all are working on the most recent version of the repository. So you don’t have to worry about mailing your files to each other and working with a ridiculous number of copies of the original file.

## Staging Area
Unlike many other source controlsystems, Git has something called the **"staging area"** or "index". This is an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.

One thing that sets Git apart from other tools is that it's possible to quickly stage some of your files and commit them without committing all of the other modified files in your working directory or having to list them on the command line during the commit.

This allows you to stage only portions of a modified file. Gone are the days of making two logically unrelated modifications to a file before you realized that you forgot to commit one of them. Now you can just stage the change you need for the current commit and stage the other change for the next commit. This feature scales up to as many different changes to your file as needed.

Of course, Git also makes it easy to ignore this feature if you don't want that kind of control — just add a **'-a'** to your commit command in order to add all changes to all files to the staging area.

## Summary
With a *Version Control System* such as **Git**, you can:

- See all the changes made to your project, when the changes were made, and who made them.
- Include a message with each change to explain the reasoning behind it.
- Retrieve past versions of the entire project or of individual files.
- Create branches, where changes can be made experimentally. This feature allows several different sets of changes (for example, features or bug fixes) to be worked on at the same time, possibly by different people, without affecting the main branch. Later, you can merge the changes you want to keep back into the main branch.
- Attach a tag to a version—for example, to mark a new release.
