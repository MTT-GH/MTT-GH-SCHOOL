## Introduction



**GitHub Issues** is a feature provided by Github that is primarily used for tracking and managing tasks, bugs, and discussions related to a particular software project. It allows developers and project collaborators to report issues they encounter, suggest new features, or discuss existing ones.

For those with Azure DevOps experience, GitHub Issues is similar to Azure DevOps **Work Items**.

As an MTT, it will be a great tool to collaborate with the Content Development teams on the provided material (mainly lab instructions).

Here are some key aspects of GitHub Issues:

- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub Issues provides a centralized platform to create, assign, and manage issues related to a project. An issue can represent a bug, a feature request, an enhancement, or any other task that needs attention.

- **Issue Details** : Users can create new issues, providing a title, description, and any relevant details (even screenshots). They can also add labels to categorize and organize issues, assign them to specific individuals or teams, and set milestones or due dates.

- **Discussion and Collaboration** : Issues serve as a hub for collaboration, allowing users to comment, discuss, and share information about the issue. This fosters communication between project stakeholders and helps in resolving the problem effectively.

- **Issue States** : GitHub Issues have different states to track their progress. Common states include "Open" (when an issue is reported or needs attention) and "Closed" (when the issue is resolved). Additionally, there are **labels** for indicating issue priorities, status, or other custom categories.

- **Notifications and Subscriptions** : Users can subscribe to specific issues to receive notifications about updates, comments, or changes. This feature ensures that relevant stakeholders stay informed and can actively participate in issue resolution.


GitHub Issues has become a widely adopted tool for issue tracking and project management in software development. It promotes collaboration, transparency, and accountability among project contributors, enabling them to address problems and improve software quality efficiently.  

## GitHub Issue Details

GitHub Issues are created from the **Issues** tab in the repository page.

Let's take a look at the details of a GitHub Issue, taking the following issue as an example:

- **Issue title** : The title of the issue should be concise and descriptive. It should clearly indicate the problem or feature request.
- **Issue number** : Each issue is assigned a unique number (on this example #3). This number is used to reference the issue in other issues, pull requests (PRs), or commits. You can easily reference an issue by typing a hash (#) followed by the issue number.
- **Labels** : Labels are used to categorize issues and help in organizing them. They can be used to indicate issue priority, status, or any other custom category. You can add multiple labels to an issue.
- **Description** : The description should provide all the relevant details about the issue. It should be concise and easy to understand. You can use Markdown to format the description and add links, images, or code snippets.
- **Development** : the **Development** section shows the **branch** where the issue is being developed and PRs associated with the issue.
- **Notification**: You can subscribe to an issue to receive notifications about updates, comments, or changes. You can also unsubscribe from an issue if you no longer want to receive notifications.
- **Assignees**: You can assign an issue to a specific user or team. This helps in tracking the issue and ensures that it is resolved by the right person.

GitHub issues also provide some other additional features, but the above are the most important ones.


## [NEW] GitHub Issue Projects

GitHub Projects is a feature that allows you to organize and prioritize your work. It is a Kanban-style tool that provides a visual overview of your project. It helps you to track the progress of your work and stay on top of your project.

**This feature will not be covered as part of the training.**
